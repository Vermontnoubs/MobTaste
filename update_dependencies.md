# Fixing PigeonUserDetails Error - Dependency Update Guide

## Problem
The error "type 'List<Object?>' is not a subtype of type 'PigeonUserDetails?' in type cast" occurs due to version incompatibilities between Firebase packages and Flutter's platform channel code.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update Dependencies
The `pubspec.yaml` has been updated with the latest Firebase versions:

```yaml
dependencies:
  firebase_core: ^3.6.0
  firebase_analytics: ^11.3.3
  firebase_auth: ^5.7.0
  cloud_firestore: ^5.4.4
  firebase_storage: ^12.3.2
```

### 2. Clean and Reinstall
Run these commands in the project root:

```bash
# Clean the project
flutter clean

# Get updated dependencies
flutter pub get

# For Android, clean gradle cache
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

# For iOS, clean pods (if applicable)
cd ios && rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock && pod install && cd ..
```

### 3. Robust Registration Implementation
The app now uses a robust registration method that:
- Tries standard registration first
- Falls back to minimal registration if PigeonUserDetails error occurs
- Uses direct Firebase Auth as final fallback
- Provides detailed error logging

### 4. Testing
Test the registration process with:
- Different user roles (client, restaurant, delivery agent)
- Various email formats
- Both new and existing email addresses

### 5. If Issues Persist
If you still encounter the error:
1. Restart the app completely
2. Clear app data (Android) or reinstall (iOS)
3. Check Firebase console for any configuration issues
4. Verify SHA-1/SHA-256 fingerprints are correctly configured

## Code Changes Made
- Updated Firebase dependencies to latest versions
- Added robust registration method with multiple fallbacks
- Enhanced error handling for PigeonUserDetails errors
- Improved logging for debugging
- Fixed type safety issues in models and services

The registration should now work reliably across all platforms and user types.
